E-commerce Customer Segmentation involves collecting customer data and applying clustering algorithms like K-means to group customers based on behavior and
demographics. The process includes defining segmentation criteria, analyzing segment traits, and tailoring marketing strategies for improved engagement.
Personalized recommendations and dynamic pricing cater to individual segment preferences. Strategies for customer retention are developed, and continuous
refinement occurs through feedback and adaptation to market trends. This approach optimizes marketing efforts, enhances customer experience, and fosters loyalty
by delivering targeted and relevant interactions for specific customer groups in the e-commerce ecosystem. 


This project involves segmenting customers of an e-commerce platform based on their purchasing behavior using Python. The main goal of the project is 
to identify distinct customer groups to tailor marketing strategies accordingly. Below is a brief description of the libraries used and the steps performed 
in this project.

Libraries Used:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions needed to work with structured data seamlessly.
NumPy: For numerical computations. It adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
Matplotlib: For data visualization. It is used to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization. It is based on Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
scikit-learn: For machine learning. Specifically, it is used here for clustering algorithms like K-means and evaluation metrics like silhouette score.
