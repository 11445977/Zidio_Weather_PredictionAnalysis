# Zidio_Weather_PredictionAnalysis
A Weather Data Analysis Data Science Project involves collecting and analyzing historical and realtime weather data. Through exploratory data analysis
and feature engineering, relevant insights are extracted for predictive modeling. Machine learning algorithms are employed to forecast weatherconditions, and accuracy 
is assessed using metrics like RMSE. Temporal and geospatial analyses provide in-depth understanding of patterns and variations. Results are communicated through interactive data
visualizations on a user-friendly web interface. The project continuously improves through feedback loops and updates, ensuring accurate and reliable weather predictions 
for specific locations.

**Libraries Used**
**Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions needed to work with structured data seamlessly.
**NumPy**: For numerical computations. It adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
**Matplotlib**: For data visualization. It is used to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
**scikit-learn**: For machine learning. Specifically, it is used here for evaluating regression models with metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Steps Performed


**LOADING THE DATA**:

The weather data is loaded from a CSV file using pd.read_csv().
The DATE column is set as the index and converted to a datetime format.
Data Preprocessing:

The year is extracted from the date index and added as a new column to the DataFrame.
Data Analysis and Visualization:

Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the data.
Visualizations are created using Matplotlib to identify trends and patterns in the weather data.
Model Evaluation:

Regression models can be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) provided by scikit-learn.
